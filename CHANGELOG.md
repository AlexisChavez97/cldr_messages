# Changelog for Cldr_Messages v0.1.0

This is the changelog for Cldr_Messages v0.1.0 released on August 26th, 2019.  For older changelogs please consult the release tag on [GitHub](https://github.com/elixir-cldr/cldr_messages/tags)

* Initial release.  This release implements `Cldr.Message.to_string/3` and `Cldr.Message.format/3`

This initial release is the basis for building a complete message localization solution as an alternative to [Gettext](https://hex.pm/packages/gettext).  There is a long way to go until that is accomplished.
